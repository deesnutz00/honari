# Database Setup and Screen Updates

## Overview
The Honari app has been updated to integrate with Supabase database and remove pink colors in favor of sky blue aesthetics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Color Scheme Updates
- **Removed**: All pink colors (`sakuraPink`, `Color.fromARGB(255, 241, 151, 181)`)
- **Replaced with**: Sky blue (`#87CEEB`) and light sky blue (`#E0F0FF`)
- **Updated screens**: Profile, Library, and Social screens

### 2. Database Integration
- **Profile Screen**: Now fetches user data and stats from database
- **Library Screen**: Displays user's books and favorites from database
- **Social Screen**: Prepared for database integration (currently uses mock data)

### 3. New Files Created
- `lib/models/user_model.dart` - User data model
- `lib/models/book_model.dart` - Book data model
- `lib/services/user_service.dart` - User database operations
- `lib/services/book_service.dart` - Book database operations
- `database_schema.sql` - Database table structure
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - This documentation

## Database Setup

### 1. Supabase Configuration
The app is already configured with Supabase in `main.dart`:
```dart
await Supabase.initialize(
  url: 'https://yriytuyeamxzcxyqtbgp.supabase.co',
  anonKey: 'your_anon_key_here',
);
```

### 2. Database Tables
Run the SQL commands in `database_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create:
- `users` - User profiles and information
- `books` - Book data uploaded by users
- `user_favorites` - User's favorite books
- `user_follows` - User following relationships
- `posts` - Social feed posts

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS)
The schema includes RLS policies to ensure:
- Users can only modify their own data
- Public data (books, posts) can be read by everyone
- Private data (favorites, follows) is properly secured
